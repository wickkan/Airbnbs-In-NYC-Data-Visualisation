# Data Visualisation of Airbnbs in New York City

I undertook this project to analyse the New York City Airbnb market in 2019, providing a detailed snapshot of the short-term rental landscape before the significant global shifts of 2020. Through interactive data visualisations, this repository explores the distribution, pricing, and availability of Airbnb listings across all five boroughs. The goal is to offer insights into how the sharing economy was shaping urban living at the time, making it a valuable resource for hosts, travelers, and urban analysts interested in the dynamics of urban accommodation
